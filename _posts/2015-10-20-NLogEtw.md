Describes the creation of a new
[custom NLog target](https://github.com/NLog/NLog/wiki/Extending%20NLog)
that provides an
[ETW source](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms751538(v=vs.110).aspx)
(Event Tracing for Windows) for event processing in Microsoft
platforms.  This is useful for applications built on NLog, that
also need to execute in ETW environments.  The code is available
on [GitHub](https://github.com/zbrad/nlogetw) and the package is
available from [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ZBrad.NLogEtw/1.0.0-beta).

## Background

I prefer to use NLog within my applications.  Recently I've been creating
microservice applications for some customer guidance using the new [Azure Service Fabric](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/campaigns/service-fabric/).
The issue is that by default, the Visual Studio templates and the debugging environment,
use ETW events for diagnostic and logging information.  During a debug session it shows a display like:

![](/images/nlogetw/vs_diag_default.jpg)

My first choice was to use an existing component, so I looked at the
existing [NLog.Etw](https://github.com/NLog/NLog.Etw) component.  Unfortunately, it does
not map well to the current tools, which expect a particular ETW manifest format
for the message.   Consequently all the events show up, but appear as blank entries in
the Visual Studio "diagnostics events" panel.  Additionally, it does not appear to
work with manifest based listeners, that is it does not define or use ETW manifests.

Consequently, I was left with creating my own provider, and using the NLog target extension
mechanism for mapping the events.

## Event Tracing for Windows (ETW)

The earliest use of ETW that I've found was in Windows Vista.
The original article that I was pointed to is from MSDN Magazine
April 2007, the article cannot be read online, but you can
[download and read the chm](http://download.microsoft.com/download/3/A/7/3A7FA450-1F33-41F7-9E6D-3AA95B5A6AEA/MSDNMagazineApril2007en-us.chm)
locally.  Don't forget to "unblock" the chm file so it can be
read after download.

The article has a good architectural picture of ETW:

The article provides a good basis for ETW intentions and design, most of our usage is focused on creating
a custom ETW provider.

## Creating a custom ETW source provider

Learning what was needed here turned out to be quite complex.
Part of this confusion is that Microsoft released the initial
ETW libraries from within the .NET Framework namespace
**System.Diagnostics.Tracing**, available in .NET 4.5.  But in
order to use some of the new features, I needed to use the
"preview" version, **Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing** available
as the [Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.TraceEvent/).  Vance
Morrison has a [detailed blog post](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vancem/archive/2015/05/11/version-1-1-24-of-the-eventsource-nuget-package-marked-as-stable.aspx) where he talks about the multi-versioning, wherefore and whys.

An additional resource was that all of the
[diagnostic reference source is now online](http://referencesource.microsoft.com/#mscorlib/system/diagnostics/eventing/eventsource.cs),
so I was able to backwards engineer some of my data structure
usage.

## Implementation details

In order to pass information to ETW in a way that would be understood by ETW listeners,
I needed a way to create an ETW manifest that consumers would understand.

In .NET 4.5, ETW introduced a way to dynamically pass a manifest, but unfortunately, have not
exposed that feature yet.  Maybe in the upcoming 4.6?   For now, we'll use the built-in mechanisms
that inherit from **EventSource** base class, and define methods with types.  The downside is that for now
we have a fixed **NLog** event source name.

```c#
[EventSource(Name = "NLog")]
```

Then for each potential event we define a method with the *Event* attribute (also see [Improvements](#improvements)):

```c#
        [Event(
            EventIds.Trace_Basic, 
            Task = Tasks.Trace, 
            Opcode = Opcodes.Basic,
            Level = EventLevel.LogAlways,
            Message = "{0}"
            )]
        public void Trace(
                string message,
                string logger,
                int sequence,
                string timestamp,
                string properties
                )
        {

        }
```

This allowed me to define a event type for each different level, with additional information from NLog.

I defined a central *WriteEtw* event, which dyanmically chose which level, and argument list,
based on type of NLog event.

```c#
var opcode = getOpcode(data);
var eventId = getId(data, opcode);
```

Since we are creating our argument list dynamically, we are actually calling through managed method which
accepts native pointers *EventSource.WriteEventCore*.  Most of the complexity here is in correctly pinning
managed references, and creating EventData arguments of the correct size.  For now, we are just supporting
int and string, but this could be extended later:

```c#
static unsafe void addEventData(EventData* d, List<GCHandle> args)
{
    for (var i = 0; i < args.Count; i++)
    {
        d[i].DataPointer = args[i].AddrOfPinnedObject();
        if (args[i].Target is string)
            d[i].Size = (((string)args[i].Target).Length + 1) * 2;  // size in bytes (include null terminator)
        else if (args[i].Target is int)
            d[i].Size = 4;
        else
            throw new ApplicationException("unhandled pinned data size");
    }
}
```

## How to use the component

- To use the component, simply include the project in your build, or download and reference the NuGet package.

- Add to your nlog.config file:

```xml
  <extensions>
    <add assembly="NLogEtw" />
  </extensions>
  <targets>
    <target xsi:type="EtwTarget" name="etw" source="TestEtwConfig" layout="${longdate}|${uppercase:${level}}|${message}${onexception:|Exception occurred\:${exception:format=tostring}}" />
  </targets>
  <rules>
    <logger name="*" minlevel="Trace" writeTo="etw" />
  </rules>
```

If you are building with Visual Studio, be sure to set the file
properties for *Copy to Output Directory* to *Copy if newer*.

### Listening to the 'NLog' source

Event listeners are keyed to guids.  When using a name like 'NLog' the EventSource/EventListener will map
the name into a guid.  For the Visual Studio Diagnostic Event panel, just add the *NLog* source to the list:

![](/images/nlogetw/config_diag.jpg)

## Ideas for improvements

Creating the *Event Methods* in order to infer the ETW manifest is
somewhat awkward.  It would be better to
[load the manifest from xml](http://referencesource.microsoft.com/#mscorlib/system/diagnostics/eventing/eventsource.cs,2887)
and then
[send the manifest](http://referencesource.microsoft.com/#mscorlib/system/diagnostics/eventing/eventsource.cs,2558)
similar to how EventSource.cs does it.

## Summary
I've now been using this component for a few weeks, and it seems ready to now make public.   Please
file any issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/zbrad/nlogetw).  I hope others will find this component
helpful.
