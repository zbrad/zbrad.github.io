Extends the previous WebSocket sample by providing a generic JavaScript
page that exercises a WebSocket endpoint.  [Example code is on GitHub](https://github.com/zbrad/webweb).

# Interacting with WebSockets

Some of the disqus feedback questions were in how to interact with the
WebSocket Service.  I've modified the original *index.html* and created a
new file *loop.html*.   Now when you navigate to your service, 
just specify the *loop.html* file.

I launch the service from Visual Studio (which by default uses *IISExpress*
to host the service).

By default this shows the index.html file.  Now we tell the browser to use our *loop.html* file instead:

![][12]

As you can see, we now have buttons for *Connect*, *Disconnect* and *Send*.  First we connect to the
WebSocket:

![][13]

Then we send it something, and get something back:

![][14]

Now to check that it's actually using what we send it, we'll modify the text in the textbox, and
send the new text:

![][15]

Ok, so it really is just sending back what we sent, let's disconnect from the socket:

![][16]

Now to verify, we'll try to send something while not connected:

![][17]

Ok, so now let's reconnect to the socket, and send it something entirely new:

![][18]

That's it, a basic loop test for looping WebSocket service.

# The JavaScript

The original script was a very simplified test, where the open/send/receive/close steps were all
driven from the load event.

The new script no longer opens a connection on page load, but instead will respond to button clicks
to perform the open/send/close steps.

The new JavaScript functions are now:
 
- doConnect
- doDisconnect
- doSendInput 

``` javascript
function doConnect() {
    socket = new WebSocket(uri);
    socket.onopen = function (e) { write("opened " + uri); };
    socket.onclose = function (e) { write("closed"); socket = null; };
    socket.onmessage = function (e) { write("Received: " + e.data); };
    socket.onerror = function (e) { if (e.data) write("Error: " + e.data); };
}
function doSendInput() {
    if (socket == null) {
        write("socket is not connected");
        return;
    }

    var text = document.getElementById("sendInput").value;
    write("Sending: " + text);
    socket.send(text);
}
function doDisconnect() {
    socket.close();
}
```

When the buttons are selected, the appropriate "doFunc" is called.   The *doSendInput* function checks to
see if there is an active connection, then reads the
text from the textbox, and sends that to the active socket.

One of the questions that I received was seeking to understand why the C# service was closing the connection.
When in fact it was the overly simplified JavaScript.  In this update, the C# service is not modified at all.

# Summary / Next Steps

The next thing that I wanted to show was how one can use a combination of JSON and WebSockets to create
message based systems that provide a high-degree of concurrency with low latency.
