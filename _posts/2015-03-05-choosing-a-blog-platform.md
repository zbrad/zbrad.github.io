A brief recap of my experiences in setting up a blog using GitHub Pages.

In my new role one of the goals is to communicate more about what we do and how we do it.  I've written web articles and a couple of books in the past but these days the primary communication and sharing vehicle seems to be the technical blog.

## Background Web Research

Before elaborating on my eventual choice of GitHub Pages (eg Jekyll), I thought that I would briefly share my review of the alternatives that I explored.

So like everyone else, I started with a google search for **Blog Software** and right up there near the top came of an item [Blog Software Review 2015 - Best Blogging Software](http://blog-software-reivew.toptenreviews.com).  And there was indeed a list of blog software, however there was also a note saying that the list had not been updated since 2012 and that it was kept there only for historical purposes.

The list they have now is:

- [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org)
- [TypePad](http://typepad.com)
- [Squarespace](http://www.squarespace.com/tour/bloggers)
- [LiveJournal](http://livejournal.com)
- [Blogger](http://blogger.com)
- [Open Salon](http://open.salon.com)

Ok ok.  I'm obviously late to the blog party.  After looking at several of these many of them seemed more oriented to writing about life in general (not a bad thing per se) but not very software technology focused.

So my next approach was to look at different technical bloggers who had written articles that I liked and determine what tools they were using.

My short list was:

- [Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/)
- [Mads Kristensen](http://madskristensen.net/)
- 

Scott:



  - Hosts his blog 
  - He uses [Windows Live Writer 2012](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/DownloadWindowsLiveWriter2012.aspx) for writing and posting his blogs
    - He personally hosts his blog on [OrcsWeb](http://orcsweb.com)
    - Uses Google AdSense for his "sponsored by" links
  - He did a great article on the different [web hosting alternatives in Azure](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PennyPinchingInTheCloudWhenDoAzureWebsitesMakeSense.aspx)
